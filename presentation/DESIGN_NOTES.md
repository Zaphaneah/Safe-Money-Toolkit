## Color Palette

| Color | Hex | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Deep Purple | `#300F48` | Primary background — conveys royalty, divinity, reverence |
| Rich Purple | `#4B196E` | Secondary background panels |
| Burgundy | `#800020` | Accent for sacrifice, blood of the cross, emphasis boxes |
| Dark Burgundy | `#500A19` | Panel backgrounds, depth |
| Gold | `#DAA520` | Accent lines, dividers, highlights — glory, divinity |
| Light Gold | `#FFD764` | Text highlights, emphasis — warmth, approachability |
| Pale Gold | `#FFEBB4` | Scripture quotes, key phrases |
| Deep Teal | `#005050` | Alternate panel color — eternity, depth |
| Warm White | `#FFF8F0` | Primary body text — soft, readable |
| Cream | `#FFF5E6` | Secondary text — sub-points |

**Rationale:** The jewel-tone palette avoids generic corporate blues. Purple conveys royalty and divinity (Christ's nature), burgundy represents sacrifice and the blood of the cross, gold symbolizes glory and divine light, and deep teal adds visual variety while suggesting depth and eternity. Together they create a reverent yet warm atmosphere appropriate for adult Bible study.

## Typography

- **Headings:** Georgia (serif) — scholarly, timeless, reads well from the back of the room
- **Body/Labels:** Calibri (sans-serif) — clean, modern, high readability
- **Sizes:**
  - Section labels: 14pt (uppercase, gold, tracking)
  - Main headings: 36–42pt (bold, warm white)
  - Body text: 18–24pt (cream/warm white)
  - Scripture quotes: 18–22pt (italic, pale gold, Georgia)
  - Greek terms: 18–28pt (italic, Georgia)

**Rationale:** The serif + sans-serif combination creates clear visual hierarchy. Georgia's large x-height ensures readability at distance. All body text exceeds 18pt for back-of-room visibility.

## Layout System

Slides 2–9 use a consistent **split-panel layout**:
- **Left half:** Full-bleed thematic artwork (6.5" wide)
- **Right half:** Dark-toned content panel with gold accent stripe
- **Gold vertical accent bar** (4pt) separates image from text

This layout ensures:
1. Visual interest on every slide without cluttering the text
2. Consistent design language throughout
3. Clear reading direction (imagery draws attention, text delivers content)
4. The teacher can gesture toward imagery while speaking

**Title slide (1) and Closing slide (10)** use centered, text-only layouts with gold accent bars and ornamental dividers for gravitas.

## Image Descriptions & Rationale

All images were generated as custom artwork using the presentation's jewel-tone palette, ensuring visual cohesion across slides.

| Slide | Image | Description | Symbolism |
|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 2 | `slide2_cross_mindset.jpg` | Luminous cross with golden light rays against deep purple sky with stars | Christ's mindset as the focal point; the cross backlit by divine glory |
| 3 | `slide3_incarnation.jpg` | Bethlehem star with descending beam of light to a small manger silhouette | God's light descending to earth — the Infinite becoming Finite |
| 4 | `slide4_emptying.jpg` | Golden vessel pouring out luminous particles into darkness | Kenosis visualized — divine essence being poured out freely |
| 5 | `slide5_humble.jpg` | Basin with water, towel, and candlelight with cross shadow | Foot-washing scene symbolism — humble service by lamplight |
| 6 | `slide6_cross_death.jpg` | Three crosses on Golgotha against blood-red and purple sky with crown of thorns | The full weight of crucifixion — shameful, painful, cursed |
| 7 | `slide7_descending.jpg` | Five 3D descending steps in graduating gold-to-burgundy with downward arrow | Visual metaphor for the five movements of Christ's descent |
| 8 | `slide8_serving_hands.jpg` | Two hands reaching toward a golden orb of light with particles | Hands in service, offering light to others — the pattern of love |
| 9 | `slide9_contemplating.jpg` | Silhouette at fork of two paths; one dim, one golden leading to a cross | Personal decision point — which path will you choose? |
